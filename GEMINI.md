gemini.md for Cloud Connect Website DuplicationThis gemini.md file outlines the structure and design considerations for duplicating the Cloud Connect website using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. This file will serve as a blueprint for gemini-cli to understand the project's architecture and content.1. Project StructureThe project will follow a standard Vue.js application structure, organized for clarity, maintainability, and scalability.cloud-connect-website/

Context for Each Folder:public/: Contains static assets that are served directly without being processed by Webpack. index.html is the entry point where the Vue application is mounted.src/: The core source code of the Vue.js application.assets/: Holds static assets like images, fonts, and global CSS files.images/: For all visual assets like logos, hero images, service icons, partner logos, etc.css/: For any custom CSS that might extend or override Tailwind, or for base styles.components/: This directory will house all the reusable Vue components. They are designed to be modular and independent.common/: Components like BaseButton.vue, InputGroup.vue, Modal.vue, Card.vue.layout/: Components that define the structure of the page, such as AppHeader.vue, AppFooter.vue, SideNav.vue.specific/: Components that are more tailored to a particular section but still reusable within that section (e.g., ServiceCard.vue, TestimonialSlider.vue).views/: Contains the main page-level components. Each .vue file here represents a distinct route/page in the application. These components orchestrate smaller components from the components/ directory to form a complete page.router/: Configures Vue Router, defining the application's navigation paths and mapping them to views components.store/: (Optional, but good practice for larger apps) If the website requires shared state management (e.g., user authentication status, global notifications, form data across pages), a Vuex or Pinia store will be configured here.App.vue: The root component that renders the main layout and includes the router view to display the current page.main.js: The entry point of the Vue application. It initializes the Vue app, imports global styles, and mounts the App.vue component to index.html.2. Design - Tailwind CSS IntegrationTailwind CSS will be the primary styling framework. It will be configured to allow for utility-first styling directly within Vue components.tailwind.config.js: This file will be configured to extend Tailwind's default theme with custom colors, fonts (e.g., Inter), spacing, breakpoints, etc., to match the Cloud Connect branding.Utility-First Approach: All styling will primarily use Tailwind's utility classes. Custom CSS will be minimized and only used for complex, non-utility-based styles or overrides.Responsive Design: Extensive use of Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) will ensure the website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).Inter Font: The "Inter" font will be used throughout the website for a clean and modern look.3. Interface Design - Components and Full LayoutThe interface design will strictly adhere to the provided screenshots (placeholder for actual screenshots). The design will be broken down into reusable Vue components, which will then be assembled into full page layouts.Component-Based Design Principles:Modularity: Each UI element that can be reused or represents a distinct section will be a separate Vue component.Reusability: Components will be designed to accept props for dynamic content, making them highly reusable across different pages or contexts.Atomic Design: Components will follow principles of atomic design where applicable (e.g., atoms like buttons, molecules like input forms, organisms like hero sections).Example Components (based on common website elements):AppHeader.vue:Logo (left)Navigation links (Home, Services, About Us, Contact)Call-to-action button (e.g., "Get a Quote" or "Sign In")Mobile hamburger menu for responsive navigation.HeroSection.vue:Large, compelling headlineSub-headline/descriptionPrimary call-to-action buttonBackground image/video or gradient.FeatureCard.vue:Icon/ImageTitleShort description(Optional) "Learn More" link.ServiceSection.vue:Section title and descriptionGrid of ServiceCard.vue components.TestimonialSlider.vue:Individual TestimonialCard.vue componentsNavigation arrows/dots.ContactForm.vue:Input fields (Name, Email, Message)Submit button.AppFooter.vue:Company logo and brief descriptionNavigation links (e.g., Quick Links, Services, Legal)Social media iconsCopyright information.Full Layout Structure (Example for a typical page, e.g., HomeView.vue):The App.vue will serve as the main layout container, including the header and footer, and dynamically rendering views.

<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <div id="app" class="font-inter antialiased text-gray-800 bg-white min-h-screen flex flex-col">
    <AppHeader />
    <main class="flex-grow">
      <router-view /> <!-- Renders the current page component (e.g., HomeView, AboutView) -->
    </main>
    <AppFooter />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import AppHeader from './components/layout/AppHeader.vue';
import AppFooter from './components/layout/AppFooter.vue';
// No specific logic needed here, router-view handles content
</script>

<style>
/* Global styles or Tailwind directives */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Custom scrollbar or other global overrides if necessary */
</style>

4. Placeholder for Specific Design Details (Based on Screenshots)IMPORTANT: This section is where the specific visual details from the provided screenshots would be translated into component structures and Tailwind CSS classes. Since no screenshots were provided, this section serves as a guide for what information would be included.For each key section/page shown in the screenshots, the following details would be provided:Page/Section Name: e.g., "Homepage - Hero Section"Key Elements: List of visible elements (e.g., "Large text heading", "Description paragraph", "Primary button", "Secondary button", "Image on right").Layout: How elements are arranged (e.g., "Flexbox layout, items-center, justify-between", "Grid layout with 3 columns on desktop").Colors: Specific Tailwind color classes or hex codes for text, backgrounds, buttons (e.g., text-blue-600, bg-gray-100, hover:bg-blue-700).Typography: Font sizes, weights, line heights (e.g., text-5xl font-bold, text-lg leading-relaxed).Spacing: Margins and paddings (e.g., py-16, px-4 md:px-8, mb-8).Responsiveness: How the layout changes on different breakpoints (e.g., "Image moves below text on md: breakpoint", "Navigation becomes a hamburger menu on sm:").Interactions/Animations: (If visible in screenshots or implied) e.g., "Button hover effects", "Smooth scrolling".Example for a hypothetical Hero Section based on a screenshot:### Homepage - Hero Section

**Screenshot Reference**: `homepage_hero_desktop.png`, `homepage_hero_mobile.png`

**Component**: `src/components/specific/HeroSection.vue`

**Description**: Full-width section with a large central heading, a descriptive paragraph, and two call-to-action buttons. A background image is subtly overlaid.

**Layout**:
* Desktop: `flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center h-screen`
* Mobile: `pt-24 pb-12` (adjust height for smaller screens)

**Colors**:
* Background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-700 to-purple-800` (or `bg-cover` with `bg-hero-pattern` from `assets/images`)
* Text: `text-white` for heading and description
* Primary Button: `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white`
* Secondary Button: `bg-transparent border border-white hover:bg-white hover:text-blue-500 text-white`

**Typography**:
* Heading: `text-4xl md:text-6xl font-extrabold leading-tight`
* Description: `text-lg md:text-xl font-light mt-4 max-w-3xl`
* Buttons: `text-base font-semibold`

**Spacing**:
* Padding: `py-24 md:py-32`
* Heading margin bottom: `mb-6`
* Button spacing: `space-x-4 mt-8` (desktop), `space-y-4 mt-8` (mobile - `flex-col`)

**Responsiveness**:
* Heading font size scales down on `md:` breakpoint.
* Buttons stack vertically on `sm:` breakpoint.
* Background image adjusts `object-cover`.

**Interactions**:
* Smooth transition on button hover (`transition-colors duration-300`).
By filling out the above "Placeholder" section with detailed observations from your actual screenshots, gemini-cli will have a clear understanding of how to generate the Vue.js components and apply the Tailwind CSS styling to precisely match your desired design.
